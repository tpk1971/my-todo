Hi this is a Simple To Do app based on a Udemy Course "Learn and Build Using Polymer" by Arman Eker

I recommend doing the course if you are starting out in Polymer. I have enhanced the course app to include
some extra features that allow for storage of the notes as well as the ability to delete and edit the notes.

Hope it is useful
